CS 61 Problem Set 1
===================

I initially worked in a different repository (https://github.com/chadsnowden3/csci-61-pst1/tree/pset1) which didn't successfully clone from the original class repository. My first submissions were with that page and the grading server indicated that my repository wasn't synched. So I created a new clone repository and copied my code changes over into it. 
**Fill out both this file and `AUTHORS.md` before submitting.** We grade
anonymously, so put all personally identifying information, including
collaborators and citations, in `AUTHORS.md`.
